EMAIL CONFIGURATION SETUP
=========================

To use the email functionality in your temperature monitoring script, you need to set up these environment variables:

Required Email Settings:
- SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com (for Gmail) or your company's SMTP server
- SMTP_PORT=587 (for Gmail TLS) or 465 (for SSL)
- SENDER_EMAIL=your-email@company.com
- SENDER_PASSWORD=your-app-password (not your regular password for Gmail)
- RECIPIENT_EMAIL=admin@company.com (who receives the reports)

Optional Settings:
- CLEANUP_FILES_AFTER_EMAIL=true (deletes files after successful email send)

FOR GMAIL USERS:
1. Enable 2-factor authentication on your Google account
2. Generate an "App Password" in Google Account settings
3. Use the app password (not your regular password)

FOR COMPANY EMAIL:
1. Contact your IT department for SMTP server details
2. Some companies require specific authentication methods

The script will send emails with:
- Subject: "Cisco switch device temperature update [timestamp]"
- Both PDF and text file attachments
- Professional email body with timestamp

If email sending fails, the files are kept locally for manual sending.
